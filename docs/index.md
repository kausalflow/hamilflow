# Documentation for `hamilflow`

Generating dataset for physical systems.

## Development

We use `poetry` to manage our python environment. Use

```sh
poetry install
```

to install the requirements. Or run

```sh
poetry install --with test
```

to install the base environment and test environment for development.


If this is the first you clone the repo and committing code, run

```sh
pre-commit install
```

first.
